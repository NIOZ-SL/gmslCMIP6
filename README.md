# gmslCMIP6
This repository can be used for pulling CMIP6 data from ESGF, preprocessing raw (monthly mean, but probably also other frequencies) 'zostoga' and 'tas' data and analyzing that data.

Instructions for running the WGET script can be found here: https://esgf.github.io/esgf-user-support/user_guide.html#download-data-from-esgf-using-wget
